          This Chicken Shawarma recipe is going to knock your socks off!

        <p class="description">
          Shawarma is a popular dish originating from the Middle East. It’s a
          popular street food that is traditionally made in the form of spiced
          meats that are stacked on a vertical rotisserie with thin slices
          shaved off as it rotates. But don’t worry! We can cook our
          horizontally in a good old pan or on the BBQ! <br />
          Shawarma was traditionally made with lamb, mutton and chicken though
          these days you see it with beef too. It’s commonly served in the form
          of a wrap, though in some countries you see it served on plates with
          sides such as seasoned rice or fries, and salads. In this recipe, I’m
          giving you both options! Here’s what you need to make Chicken
          Shawarma. I’m betting you have most if not all of the spices in your
          pantry already!

        <ul class="ingredients-list">
          <li class="ingredient">
            <span class="ingredients-title">Chicken</span> – I like to make
            Shawarma with boneless, skinless thighs as its juicier than breast.
            But chicken breast and tenderloin both work great.
          </li>
          <li class="ingredient">
            <span class="ingredients-title">Lemon juice</span> – Fresh!
          </li>

          <li class="ingredient">
            <span class="ingredients-title">Olive oil</span> – For a touch of
            flavour but also to dilute the lemon juice so it doesn’t “cook” the
            chicken (like we intentionally do with ceviche!).
          </li>

          <li class="ingredient">
            <span class="ingredients-title">Spices</span> – Nothing out of the
            ordinary here! The only one you might not have in stock is cardamom,
            though these days its easily found at any grocery store. It has a
            piney, sort of citrusy flavour and it is a key ingredient that
            distinguishes the Shawarma marinade from other cuisines, such as
            Mexican, that regularly uses the other spices used in this recipe.
            In short, don’t skip it!
          </li>
          <li class="ingredient">
            <span class="ingredients-title">Spice control</span>
            – The spiciness in the Shawarma marinade comes from the cayenne
            pepper. It’s not a key element of the flavour so if you don’t want
            it spicy, either reduce or eliminate it altogether. I promise you
            won’t feel robbed. Lots of other flavours going on in this dish!

        <ol class="steps-list">
          <li class="ingredient">
            Mix marinade – For convenience, just mix the marinade directly in a
            ziplock bag. A bag works best because the chicken remains nicely
            coated in the marinade. If you prefer to use a container, either
            turn the chicken a few times or increase the marinade by 50%.
          </li>
          <hr style="visibility: hidden" />

          <li class="ingredient">
            Add chicken into the marinade. Seal the bag, removing excess air,
            then massage to coat from the outside. Leave to marinade for 12 to
            24 hours in the fridge. If you’re pressed for time, even 3 hours
            will do!
          </li>
          <hr style="visibility: hidden" />

          <li class="ingredient">
            Yogurt sauce – Make the yogurt sauce simply by mixing the
            ingredients then set aside for at least 20 minutes to let the
            flavours meld. This will keep for 3 days in the fridge.
          </li>
          <li class="ingredient">
            Cook chicken either on the stove or on the BBQ. It will get a great
            crust on it from the spices, and you will adore the smell. It’s
            intoxicating!
          </li>
          <hr style="visibility: hidden" />

          <li class="ingredient">
            Rest chicken for at least 3 minutes before serving to allow the
            juices to redistribute throughout the flesh, else they will just run
            out everywhere when you slice the meat.
          </li>
          <hr style="visibility: hidden" />

          <li class="ingredient">
            To serve, just pile everything on a platter and let everybody make
            their own wraps! The chicken, lettuce, tomato slices, onion, yogurt
            sauce and warmed flatbreads – homemade or store bought. If the
            chicken is on the larger side, I sometimes slice it. But if they are
            smaller, I tend to just leave them whole.
