        <p class="description">
          Here’s something new to try with that packet of beef mince you throw
          into your shopping cart every week! The beef is stir fried with chow
          mein sauce until it’s beautifully caramelised then tossed in a tangle
          of noodles and vegetables.
          <br />
          A neat trick in today’s recipe is to scramble up an egg with the beef.
          It makes the beef bits stick to the noodles better, with the added
          bonus of upping the protein.

        <ul class="ingredients-list">
          <li class="ingredient">
            <span class="ingredients-title">Noodles<span class="ingredients-title"> – Chow mein noodles are sort of dry and crinkly, rather than
            oily and straight like hokkien noodles, lo mein noodles. But this
            dish can really be made with any noodles – or even spaghetti (yes
            really, who’s going to know once tossed in chow mein sauce??). Use
            the same weight.
          </li>
          <li class="ingredient">
            <span class="ingredients-title">Garlic</span> – Rarely do Asian stir
            fries happen without garlic, and this one is no exception!
          </li>
          <li class="ingredient">
            <span class="ingredients-title">Beef mince</span> – That’s ground
            beef to Americans. Any fat % is fine here though lean beef won’t
            caramelise quite as well.
          </li>
          <li class="ingredient">
            <span class="ingredients-title">Egg</span> – We use this to scramble
            into the beef. Neat trick to make the beef stick to the noodles
            better with the added bonus of a free protein boost!
          </li>
          <li class="ingredient">
            <span class="ingredients-title">Green cabbage</span> – Or Chinese
            cabbage. Finely sliced so it disappears into the tangle of noodles.
          </li>
          <li class="ingredient">
            <span class="ingredients-title">Bean sprouts</span> – Excellent
            grab-and-throw-in vegetable option!
          </li>
          <li class="ingredient">
            <span class="ingredients-title">Carrot</span> – Cut into thin
            batons. More noodle shaped vegetables so it all jumbles up together!
          </li>
          <li class="ingredient">
            <span class="ingredients-title">Green onion</span> – We use 3 whole
            stems here. They are the onion in this dish, as well as some fresh
            green colour.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ol class="steps-list">
          <li class="ingredient">
            Prepare the noodles per the packet directions then drain. I usually
            get the water boiling while I’m prepping the vegetables then cook
            the noodles when I start cooking. The chow mein noodles I get just
            call for soaking in hot water for 3 minutes. Some brands need to be
            boiled.
          </li>
          <hr style="visibility: hidden" />
          <li class="ingredient">
            Caramelise beef – Using a large non-stick pan, cook the garlic first
            to flavour the oil. Then cook the beef, breaking it up as you go,
            until you can no longer see raw beef.
          </li>
          <hr style="visibility: hidden" />
          <li class="ingredient">
            Finish sauce – Meanwhile, mix the cornflour slurry into the
            remaining sauce.
          </li>
          <li class="ingredient">
            Scramble egg – Add the egg into the pan then mix it through the
            beef, it will sort of scramble into the mixture. This is what makes
            beef stick to the noodles better!
          </li>
          <hr style="visibility: hidden" />
          <li class="ingredient">
            Keep cooking! – When the egg is mostly cooked, add the carrot and
            cabbage. Cook for 1 minute until cabbage starts to wilt.
          </li>
          <hr style="visibility: hidden" />
          <li class="ingredient">
            Sauce & noodles – Give the sauce a quick mix. Add the bean sprouts,
            noodles and sauce into the pan. Toss well for 1 minute or until
            sauce is dispersed through the noodles. Add green part of green
            onions. Toss for another 1 minute, then serve!
