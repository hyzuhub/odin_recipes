    <h2>Are you ready to meet the ultimate cheese toastie??</h2>
    <p>
      While it comes down to personal taste and convenience / speed, for me the
      grilled cheese wins hands down. The bread gets too squished in toasties
      and sandwich makers – even the ones that have a “thick set” option.
      <br />
      The weight of the lid presses down on the bread too much. This also causes
      cheese to ooze out, limiting the amount you can put in the sandwich to
      not-enough. Travesty!!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bread – This recipe will work fine with any sliced bread (sandwich, loaf
        etc) though you want to ensure the slices are not too thick (cheese
        might not melt), too thin or too soft (will get squished by the cheese)
        or too holey (cheese-escape-routes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Cheese options – For the best grilled cheese, you want to use a
        combination of mozzarella (for its cheese pull and non-greasy melting
        qualities) with a flavoured cheese – because mozzarella actually has a
        very mild flavour. A good vintage cheddar or gruyere are my absolute
        favourites.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salted butter – Just your everyday butter that you use to spread on
        bread and crackers. Else, use unsalted and add a light sprinkle of salt.
        Trust me – you really want the salt!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Grate cheese – If not using store bought pre-sliced cheese, grate the
        cheese using a standard box grater. As noted above, store bought
        pre-shredded cheese is coated with anti-caking agents which prevents it
        from melting properly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Butter both sides of each bread. Yes that’s right, all four sides. Trust
        me on this!
      </li>
      <li>
        Head start fry – Place the bread in a pre-heated heavy based skillet or
        non-stick fry pan over medium low heat. Let it lightly toast just for 1
        minute. This will give this side of the bread a little extra toasty
        flavour as well as giving the cheese melting a head start – because we
        are going to flip the bread before piling the cheese on.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip bread & cheese it! Turn one slice of bread then pile the cheese on
        top (any order). Place the other piece of bread on top with the hot
        toasted side in contact with the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        3 minutes – Press down lightly and cook for 3 minutes until the
        underside is a deep, even golden brown colour. If it is browning too
        quickly, remove the pan from the stove, let it cool slightly and lower
        the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn, 3 minutes – Carefully turn the sandwich. Cook the other side for
        another 3 minutes until golden and crisp, and (most importantly!) the
        cheese is melted. Take a quick peek if you are unsure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Golden brown – This is what your bread should look like from edge to
        edge! A deep golden brown, even coloured, crisp. You know this is going
        to be good!
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut – Transfer to a cutting board and cut in half, decisively and with
        intention. And then….wait for it…. THE CHEESE PULL!
