        <p class="description">
          While it comes down to personal taste and convenience / speed, for me
          the grilled cheese wins hands down. The bread gets too squished in
          toasties and sandwich makers – even the ones that have a “thick set”
          option.
          <br />
          The weight of the lid presses down on the bread too much. This also
          causes cheese to ooze out, limiting the amount you can put in the
          sandwich to not-enough. Travesty!!

        <ul class="ingredients-list">
          <li class="ingredient">
            <span class="ingredients-title">Bread</span> – This recipe will work
            fine with any sliced bread (sandwich, loaf etc) though you want to
            ensure the slices are not too thick (cheese might not melt), too
            thin or too soft (will get squished by the cheese) or too holey
            (cheese-escape-routes).
          </li>
          <li class="ingredient">
            <span class="ingredients-title">Cheese options</span> – For the best
            grilled cheese, you want to use a combination of mozzarella (for its
            cheese pull and non-greasy melting qualities) with a flavoured
            cheese – because mozzarella actually has a very mild flavour. A good
            vintage cheddar or gruyere are my absolute favourites.
          </li>
          <li class="ingredient">
            <span class="ingredients-title">Salted butter</span> – Just your
            everyday butter that you use to spread on bread and crackers. Else,
            use unsalted and add a light sprinkle of salt. Trust me – you really
            want the salt!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <hr class="solid" />
        <ol class="steps-list">
          <li class="ingredient">
            Grate cheese – If not using store bought pre-sliced cheese, grate
            the cheese using a standard box grater. As noted above, store bought
            pre-shredded cheese is coated with anti-caking agents which prevents
            it from melting properly.
          </li>
          <hr style="visibility: hidden" />

          <li class="ingredient">
            Butter both sides of each bread. Yes that’s right, all four sides.
            Trust me on this!
          </li>
          <hr style="visibility: hidden" />

          <li class="ingredient">
            Head start fry – Place the bread in a pre-heated heavy based skillet
            or non-stick fry pan over medium low heat. Let it lightly toast just
            for 1 minute. This will give this side of the bread a little extra
            toasty flavour as well as giving the cheese melting a head start –
            because we are going to flip the bread before piling the cheese on.
          </li>
          <hr style="visibility: hidden" />

          <li class="ingredient">
            Flip bread & cheese it! Turn one slice of bread then pile the cheese
            on top (any order). Place the other piece of bread on top with the
            hot toasted side in contact with the cheese.
          </li>
          <li class="ingredient">
            3 minutes – Press down lightly and cook for 3 minutes until the
            underside is a deep, even golden brown colour. If it is browning too
            quickly, remove the pan from the stove, let it cool slightly and
            lower the heat.
          </li>
          <hr style="visibility: hidden" />

          <li class="ingredient">
            Turn, 3 minutes – Carefully turn the sandwich. Cook the other side
            for another 3 minutes until golden and crisp, and (most
            importantly!) the cheese is melted. Take a quick peek if you are
            unsure.
          </li>
          <hr style="visibility: hidden" />

          <li class="ingredient">
            Golden brown – This is what your bread should look like from edge to
            edge! A deep golden brown, even coloured, crisp. You know this is
            going to be good!
          </li>
          <hr style="visibility: hidden" />

          <li class="ingredient">
            Cut – Transfer to a cutting board and cut in half, decisively and
            with intention. And then….wait for it…. THE CHEESE PULL!
